# [Coffee Junkie Remix](https://coffee-junkie-remix.netlify.app)

This is my first Web Development project that is using HTML/CSS (with a small amount of JavaScript sprinkled for smooth scroll)

Inspired by "Coffee Junkie" HTML project, included in HTML/CSS course by John Smilga.

# Side Note

This project was created when I had almost zero knowledge about Javascript and I decided to preserve website that way.

# Appretiation Note

Thanks, Mr. John Smilga, your courses are very helpful!
